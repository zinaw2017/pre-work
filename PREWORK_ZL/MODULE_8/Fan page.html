<h3> Bio <h3/>
<P>A number of music critiques lament Ethiopian music as something that has “stuck in the past”. But with Jano Addis’s instinct and energy is up for something high.

   <Br>Having listened to the preview of a soon-to-be launched ten track debut album entitled “Ertale”, named after a place in Eastern Ethiopia where a volcano comes to an extraordinary active lava, one could easily get the sense of Addis’s vision. Jano’s tempo is nothing like Ethiopian music as we know it. It audaciously breaks the rules of the familiar melody to bring about a new rocking sensation.<br>

    <br>Jano has a unique way of showing the flare of its members, who, some of them came from different gospel choirs. The fusion of Ethiopian music with Rock is a complete detachment from the long tradition of music norm. But the songs are partly written by the band members themselves and partly by Yilma Gabreab, a popular Ethiopian song writer. The result is the first ever rock band in Ethiopia.<p/>
